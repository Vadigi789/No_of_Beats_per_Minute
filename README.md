Project: Predicting Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) of Songs

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict the tempo (Beats-Per-Minute) of songs based on their audio features. The goal is to automatically estimate the BPM of a track, which is an essential property in music analysis, recommendation systems, and applications like playlist generation or DJ software.

üîç Problem Statement

Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) is a measure of tempo in music. While it can be computed through signal processing, it is often challenging due to variations in rhythm, instrumentation, and recording quality. In this project, we treat BPM prediction as a supervised regression problem using structured features extracted from songs.

üìä Dataset

The dataset contains several features representing the musical and acoustic characteristics of songs, such as:

Rhythm and tempo-related metrics

Energy, mood, and instrumental scores

Audio loudness and vocal content

Track duration and acoustic quality

The target variable is BeatsPerMinute, which we aim to predict from these features.

üõ† Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examined feature distributions, correlations, skewness, and outliers.

Visualized feature interactions using heatmaps and pairplots.

Preprocessing:

Handled skewed distributions with transformations.

Standardized numerical features where required.

Dealt with outliers to improve model robustness.

Modeling:

Tested multiple algorithms:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Regressor (to capture nonlinear patterns)

Other ensemble or boosting models (optional extensions).

Evaluation:

Used appropriate regression metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to measure prediction accuracy.

Performed cross-validation to ensure model generalization.

üöÄ Outcome

The trained model provides reliable predictions of BPM values from the given song features. The workflow demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights generation, making it a strong foundation for music analytics applications.
